# Changelog

All notable changes to jagc are documented here.

This project follows a readable, sectioned changelog format with a permanent **Unreleased** section.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- _None yet._

### Changed

- `pnpm test:pack` now asserts packaged defaults include `defaults/skills/**` and verifies workspace bootstrap creates `skills/*` from bundled defaults.

### Fixed

- Telegram progress updates now flush the latest buffered thinking snippet before tool/text lifecycle events, preventing stale mid-token previews like `~ **Listing` when newer thinking deltas already arrived.
- npm package contents now include `defaults/skills/**` (and `defaults/extensions/**`), restoring default skill bootstrap for fresh installs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- npm-distributable CLI package (`jagc`) with built artifacts and curated package contents.
- First supported macOS deployment path via top-level CLI service commands:
  - `jagc install`
  - `jagc status`
  - `jagc restart`
  - `jagc uninstall`
  - `jagc doctor`
- Launchd-managed per-user service installation with workspace-scoped logs and safety defaults.
- Package smoke loop (`pnpm test:pack`) validating tarball install + runnable server + CLI roundtrip.
- CI release gate workflow (`pnpm release:gate`) on GitHub Actions.

### Changed

- Deployment docs now treat macOS npm+launchd as the primary supported install path.
- Local release gate consolidated into a single canonical command.
- Project license changed from UNLICENSED to MIT (`LICENSE` added).

### Fixed

- Service status/restart/doctor health targeting now resolves host/port from installed service config.
- Service command failures now return clean one-line CLI errors (no stack dumps).
- Service manager no longer selects TypeScript server entrypoints for launchd runtime.
